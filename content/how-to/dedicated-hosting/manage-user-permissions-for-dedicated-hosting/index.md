This article describes user permissions for Dedicated Hosting and shows you
how to manage these permissions.

You manage permissions in the [MyRackspace
portal](https://login.rackspace.com) under **Account > Permissions**.

**Note**: To access the **Permissions** area in the MyRackspace Portal and
modify another userâ€™s permissions, you must have either the **Account
Administrator** permission or the **Admin** permission. The **Account
Administrator** permission grants the user unlimited access to all sections of
the MyRackspace Portal. The **Admin** permission (on a device or service)
grants the user the ability to access and manage the device or service.

If you don't find the information you need here, then review the **FAQ** section on the left
for answers to common user permission problems.

### Categories of permissions

The following categories of permissions are available for Dedicated Hosting
accounts:

- **Direct permissions**: Grant the user direct access to
  account permissions, linked cloud accounts, devices, or services.

- **Effective permissions**: Are inherited as a result of their memberships in user and product groups.

**Note**: You can grant a user a combination of direct and effective
permissions. MyRackspace uses the highest level of permission granted.

### Manage global permissions

The **Global Permissions** section enables you to make changes across your

**Ticketing Settings** enables you to control the tickets that your users have
permission to see when those tickets concern one or more devices.

The following table shows the ticketing settings that are required for common
actions or views:
{{< table "table  table-striped table-bordered" >}}
| Ticketing setting  | Functionality |
|---------|--------|
| Flexible Ticket Viewing (default setting)     | Enables users to see tickets that include a device that they have permission to view. For example, if a user has access to device A, they see all of the tickets that include device A, even if another device is on the ticket. If device C is later added to the ticket and the user does not have access to device C, the user can still see the ticket.   |
| Strict Ticket Viewing     | Requires users to have access to all of the devices on a ticket in order to see that ticket. For example, if a ticket includes device A and device B, then the user must have permissions to both devices to see the ticket. If device C is later added to the ticket and the user does not have access to device C, the user is no longer be able to see the ticket.   |
